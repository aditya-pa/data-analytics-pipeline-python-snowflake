We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. \\n\\nThe food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.\",\"date\":\"2018-07-07 22:09:11\"}\n",

From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.\\n\\nFor anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).\\n\\nThere is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in\\/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!\",\"date\":\"2012-01-03 15:28:18\"}\n",

Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails.
